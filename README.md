# Lecture Notes for Data Engineering w/ Ken Anderson

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/cu-data-engineering-s15)

## Lecture 1 - 1/13/15

Anderson is asking us to make this as a first assignment. I'm excited for the class.

####General Flow of Class:

Thursday:
- New Area
- Intro
- Looking up frameworks

Tuesday:
Presentations

####Data analytics
  - Sampling ... Machine Learning
  - Statistics largely based on sampling. If you already know the answer, not really statistics.

#### Storage
  - Data modeling is very hard - i.e. data formatting in facebook. New posts will have a different format than the old posts. They wont convert the old posts into the new data type.
  - NoSQL
    - Graph
    - Key-Value Stores
    - Columnar

####Twitter
  - Twitter Clients -> Twitter <- Tweet
  - Sometimes twitter clients use different encoding than utf-8 
  - Twitter uses utf-8
  - End tweet is half utf-8 and half different encoding (hard to perform analytics on)
    - i.e. python would expect it to be all utf-8, blows up if different

####Info Viz
  - D3 (visualiztion - graphs)
  - excel / R (data analysis)

####Data Lifecycle
0. Question
  * Curation / Triage Persistence  - prioritization of data sources
  * Which source will give me the answer?
1. Collection / Generation
2. Cleanup
3. Storage
4. Processing / Analysis
5. Query / visualize / ACT (data transformed to knowledge we can act upon)
  * This usually gives you new questions

This lifecycle is in many startup companies that do big data
Teams of people within each step.


####Request Response Cycle
http://
http request methods
  * GET
  * POST
  * PUT
  * DELETE

Some request comes out, associated with url
server recieves url maps request to file and returns back a response
